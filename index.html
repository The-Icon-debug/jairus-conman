   <h1>Conman:The Life and Crimes Of Jairus Martin Amoth</h1>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p style="color: fuchsia;"><strong>Jairus Martin Amoth</strong> was born in <em>Nyanza, Ojwando Sub-Location</em> on the 5th of September 1995. No one expected him to become the conman and fraudster he is today. He dropped out of <em>Kenyatta University</em> in 2018 where he was pursuing a <em>Bsc. Degree in Nutrition</em>.</p>
       Jairus was fond of cheating in the continuous assessments as well as in the examinations. Some lecturers knew him solely for this reason. At one point, he tried bribing his fellow students to undertake his exams on his behalf. This pattern of behavior, shortcuts and underhand methods, would come to foreshadow his life in the streets away from school. Since his mighty fallout with Education, dozens of individuals have lost their fortunes to Mr. Jairus Martin Amoth. He disguises himself and hides behind a facade of successful Forex trader, but he is a scammer, fraudster and a conman. Ever since his great expoze and feeling the heat of being pursued, he relocated to Kilimani from Kahawa Wendani. Jairus Conman has been exposed, and the police will soon be catching up with him.

  <h3>"The Forex Guru"</h3>
  <p>Around the same time he dropped out of the university, Jairus had found himself a new career path. He was now a forex coach, mentor and a trader. His first cohort comprised of university students and friends. He was going to introduce them into this whole new exciting venture of financial freedom. No need to seek employment anymore. The charges were Ksh. 10,000 and the classes would happen around Garden City. To this day, none of his students have become consistent profit makers in the forex industry. This goes without saying, like master, like apprentice. Mr. Jairus himself is not a consistent profit maker in the forex industry.
  He knew it was easier to make quick money by teaching a bunch of people than by trading the treacherous market. A con artist in the making. HIs students are synonymous with blowing accounts and losing money just like their mentor.</p> 
  <h3>"The Financial Venom Robot"</h3>
  Towards the end of 2020, Jairus Martin began advertising the launch of a new cutting-edge product in the forex industry. His so called "The financial venom robot" or sometimes the "poverty vaccine". It was screenshot after screenshot of how much profit the robot was making and most people became excited and were eagerly awaiting for this "miracle" that would change their financial position and status for good. Most people were already having a difficult year due to the covid-19 surge and the consequent financial impact it had brought.Some people who had lost their jobs or had been forced to close down their businesses, saw this as an opportunity to aid them in regaining their financial status and even become millionaires with time. 
  However, the truth is bitter than their sense of imagination. The once hyped robot was finally launched and people from all financial backgrounds were racing to get their lifetime copy. On his whatsapp status, conman Jairus would always post and claim that only limitrd copies were left and it would be sold on a first come first serve basis. Unknown to investors, Jairus played no role whatsover in coming up with this product. He had found someone selling it on the internet and saw an opportunity to score some quick bucks. What a joker! He promised investors that the robot is 100% safe and can never lose money and has never lost money.
  It was a great period of excitement to all investors. Finally, their financial status is soon going to change for good. And so it was true, their financial position changed but not in the direction thay had anticipated after all the empty promises made to them by a university-dropout. The robot was probably designed by a 12-year old kid in China. It employed a very risky trading stategy called the Martingale startegy. Investors lost money in the range of millions of Ksh. Some people had taken loans to invest and soon it hit them that they are trapped with loans to repay in the face of global pandemic. 
  <h3>"The Fake MCA"</h3>
  <h3>The fall of the conman Jay</h3>
  <p>
   We use social media platforms such as facebook in many different ways. Today I'll be using Facebook to expose a con artist based in Kenya. He conned a group of 7 youths who trusted him as a mentor the sum of Ksh. 500,000 or equivalently around $5000. Well, this might seem like a small amount but he conned youths who literally work hand to mouth to feed themselves as well as their siblings(brothers and sisters ) at home.
   The conman goes by the name Jairus Martin (Jay) on Facebook,
   His Kenyan phone number is +254707792845,
   His U.S number is +17862337642
   
   
   His Facebook link is https://www.facebook.com/jairus.martin.315
   
   
   
   His photo is shown below. Help me spread this information. He is the Kenyan version of the Tinder Swindler.
   The youths who lost money to this fraud can no longer sustain their livelihoods. Some of them lost family property. For some of them, they can no longer support their siblings with school fees. Now their siblings' education has been cut short.
   Jairus Martin (Jay) might have conned a few people but his actions have affected dozen of humble families.
   His Kenyan phone number is +254707792845, send him a message to let him know what his actions have brought upon the lives of innocent children who can no longer go to school, and to families that go without food for days since they lost everything to this conman.
   He conned the youths, who stay at Kahawa Wendani, Kiambu, Kenya and went ahead to buy himself a car which he brags with online. To make it worse, after being exposed as a con, he uses police to intimidate his victims. He just confessed that he will use the police to kill his victims in order to silence them. Let the world know about Jairus Martin (Jay).
   Kindly, help me share this message far and wide. Thank you all so much.
